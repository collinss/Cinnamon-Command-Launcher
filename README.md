Cinnamon-Command-Launcher
=========================

This is a simple multi-instance applet for Cinnamon which allows the user to launch commands as though from a command prompt with the click of a button. Unlike a program launcher, which typically uses a .desktop to launch a program, Command Launcher uses a direct command-line command. This means you can use any command you could use from a terminal (eg run a script, launch program with complicated command-line arguments, etc).

To use this desklet run (must have git installed):

    cd ~/.local/share/cinnamon/desklets/
    git clone https://github.com/collinss/Cinnamon-Soundbox.git soundBox@scollins

or download and extract contents to ~/.local/share/cinnamon/desklets/soundBox@scollins/
